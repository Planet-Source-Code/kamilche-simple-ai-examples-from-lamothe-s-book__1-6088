## Simple AI Examples from LaMothe's Book


</div>

### Description

The book "Tricks of the Game Programming Gurus" by Andre LaMothe, copyright 1994, has an interesting chapter on artifical intelligence. However, all the samples in the chapter are done up in C. I've redone them into VB just for the heck of it.

There are 5 simple programs illustrating chasing, evasion, patterned movement, random movement, and a program that combines all of the above.
